# Evaluation of natural language processing embeddings in protein function prediction for bacteria
This project was created as part of the **2021-2022 Bachelor Research Project at Delft University of Technology**.
Access to the bachelor thesis is provided on the TU Delft repository: [to-add].

The contents of this repository include the data used in our experiments, and the scripts for the implementation and evaluation of the prediction models.
